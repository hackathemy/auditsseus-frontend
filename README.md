## Overview  
Auditsseus is an AI audit assistant service that automatically analyzes AI-generated creative content—such as images, videos, papers, and music—and compares it with existing IPs to detect potential plagiarism.
Based on Eliza and the Story Protocol Plugin, Auditsseus vectorizes uploaded content in real time and performs similarity comparisons with existing IP collections. It then provides a detailed report including plagiarism rates and similar references.
Furthermore, based on the analysis, Auditsseus assists in automatically registering the content as on-chain IP using Story Protocol, with a strong focus on protecting users’ creative works within the Web3 ecosystem.
